A hackweek project of mine, currently in a very early state.

# Hawaii

A Luau packager built ontop of Lune!

## Building

This project can be built by installing lune, then running the command:

```
lune run .lune
```

For now, this runs a quickly put together build script that builds an uncompressed,
uncompiled HWI file for debugging.

As this project develops, hopefully I'll be able to make it compile itself so
we dont need this.
