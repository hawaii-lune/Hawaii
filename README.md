A hackweek project of mine, currently in a very early state.

# Hawaii

A Luau packager built ontop of Lune!

## Building

This project can be built by installing lune, then running the command:

```
lune run .lune
```

This has built itself successfully and the build file can be found in releases,
we will use this to incrementally build the project from now on, but should still
not be used for runtime logic as of current.
